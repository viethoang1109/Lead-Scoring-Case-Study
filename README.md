## Objective:
  X Education, an educational company, specializes in the sale of online courses to professionals in various industries. Daily, numerous professionals interested in their courses visit the company's websites and explore available options. The company employs diverse marketing strategies, utilizing multiple websites and search engines such as Google to promote its courses. Upon landing on the website, visitors may peruse courses, fill out course-related forms, or view instructional videos. Individuals who provide their contact information, such as email addresses or phone numbers, are categorized as leads. Additionally, the company acquires leads through referrals.

  After obtaining leads, the sales team initiates contact through calls, emails, and other means. While some leads result in conversions, a majority do not, with X Education maintaining an average lead conversion rate of approximately 30%. Despite generating a significant number of leads, the company faces challenges in improving its lead conversion rate. For instance, out of 100 acquired leads in a day, only about 30 are typically converted.

  To enhance efficiency, the company aims to identify the most promising leads, referred to as 'Hot Leads.' Identifying this subset of leads is expected to boost the lead conversion rate, as the sales team can concentrate efforts on communicating with potential leads rather than reaching out to everyone indiscriminately. The proposed solution involves developing a logistic regression model that assigns a lead score ranging from 0 to 100 to each lead. A higher score indicates a hotter lead, more likely to convert, while a lower score suggests a colder lead with lower conversion potential. The model should also be adaptable to accommodate any future changes in the company's requirements, addressing additional issues outlined in a separate document. The final presentation should encompass the logistic regression model's details, its application in handling specified problems, and comprehensive insights for the company's consideration.
